## Key ideas
- Its important to create the card in such a way that they can be used by our future self in say 3-6 months because the goal here is to upload whatever the information is on the cards into our brains for ever so that we become better version of ourselves. 
- trap with flashcards is that we become to focused on memorizing stuff. We should first understand it first then after that for each card there should be more context, so the use of the extra feature or the close deletion type is very useful for this.

## keyboard commands
- A to add a new card to a deck
- spacebar to reaveal answer
- cmd+shift+c on a marked word to create a cloze deletion thingy
- pressing e when viewing a card opens up a edit view of that card. 
- pressing the numbers 1,2,3 is for saying "again" "good" "easy" for the answer to a card. If I find myself pressing easy then I should really question why I even have that card to begin with, i.e i should really never find myself in the situation where i press 3.

## Card types
- There is the reverse card type where it adds two diffrent cards so it says France --> Paris and Paris --> France is then also created. 
- cloze deletion is anther type one can pick when making cards. This type is usefull for memorizing or remembering sentences. What it does is essentially that it creates "fill in the blank" type cards. And to choose which blank card we just add {{c1::BlankWord}} and c2 if its the second one etc, this can also be done by pressing the [...] icon in the UI. And if we add more then 1 such gap then there will be gap-many number of cards added where it alternates between the two possible gaps. If we do {{c1::BlankWord::hint}} a second set of :: then whatever we write after those becomes the hint for whatever is the blankword we are looking for, this goes very well with the first key point above. For this type of card there is also an extra column or space that's under "extra", Here it is possible to add images or any other extra information regarding the question with the blanks. 

## Addons
- Image occlusion addon. This addons lets you hide certain areas of a picture, so that it works like the cloze deletion card type but for images.
