## Key ideas
- Its important to create the card in such a way that they can be used by our future self in say 3-6 months because the goal here is to upload whatever the information is on the cards into our brains for ever so that we become better version of ourselves. 

## keyboard commands
- A to add a new card to a deck
- spacebar to reaveal answer
- cmd+shift+c on a marked word to create a cloze deletion thingy

## Card types
- There is the reverse card type where it adds two diffrent cards so it says France --> Paris and Paris --> France is then also created. 
- cloze deletion is anther type one can pick when making cards. This type is usefull for memorizing or remembering sentences. What it does is essentially that it creates "fill in the blank" type cards. And to choose which blank card we just add {{c1::BlankWord}} and c2 if its the second one etc, this can also be done by pressing the [...] icon in the UI. And if we add more then 1 such gap then there will be gap-many number of cards added where it alternates between the two possible gaps. If we do {{c1::BlankWord::hint}} a second set of :: then whatever we write after those becomes the hint for whatever is the blankword we are looking for, this goes very well with the first key point above.
