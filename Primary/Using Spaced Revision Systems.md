# Using Spaced Revision Systems (Anki)
(note to self one might find all of the following as too much work. But know that it is very rare that one does all of the steps below and one should not even do that since and obsession with completionism will just drain you. This guide is intended to give me a good start of using these systems and be exhaustive so that I will have most of what i need in one place once and for all)

There is a few different types of knowledge. There is factual knowledge, procedural knowledge and conceptual knowledge. This guide will go through how to use space revision for all of these types.

## Key Commentary from the source
-  I‚Äôve noticed that people often feel a compulsion to economize on the number of prompts they write. Prompts seem to carry a per-unit ‚Äúprice,‚Äù so people naturally try to write fewer questions which cover more ground. But that‚Äôs counter-productive. Unless you explicitly decide to exclude certain information, the number of ‚Äúunits of raw knowledge‚Äù is fixed, a constant of the territory. When you write coarser prompts in smaller quantity, you‚Äôre not reducing the amount you have to learn. You‚Äôre just making the material harder to review.

## Procedural and Factual knowledge

### Factual 
For Factual knowledge once we start reading we store stuff like "What type of chicken parts are used in stock?" A; Bones. Another and more useful type of card once we have gained some familiarity with the subject at hand would be "Why do we use bones to make chicken stock?" etc. But note that there could be different answers to this question and so while its a good first step it's not certain that we give the same answer, a better formulation of the second question would be "How do bones produce a chicken stock's rich texture?". 

If learning lists of facts that are related keep the lists in the same order and always ask for only one of the items in the list for each card, but use multiple cards to ask for all the different items in the list. Then once we have some familiarity and can remember the items we can start asking question like "why is item X used in the context of Y " so going with the cooking example that question would e phrased like "_why_ is carrot a good aromatic for chicken stock?"

Make extensive use of images in your anki cards. 

Writing good cards more often then not requires interpretation, which means extracting information from the source material that is not explicitly written. 

## Procedural
Procedures are usually steps in some kind of order and can be thought of as lists. When trying to learn Procedures it is smart to not ankify steps that are common sense just because they are written in the source that we are using. Flow charts are a smart thing to include if the procedure is complex with many conditions leading to different paths. Explanation-type questions are especially valuable when studying procedures, they help avoid rote learning and instead aid in getting a deeper understanding. 


## Conceptual Knowledge
The following will be some ways of memorizing and understanding concepts. There is no need to use all of the methods for every concept.

In the following examples below assume that we are trying to learn about the concept of chicken stock.

1. **Attributes and tendencies** What makes stock, stock? What‚Äôs always, sometimes, and never true of stock?

2. **Similarities and differences** Knowing what stock is requires knowing what relates and distinguishes it from other adjacent concepts.

3. **Parts and wholes** What are some examples of stocks? Are there important ‚Äúsub-concepts‚Äù of stocks? Is ‚Äústock‚Äù a part of some broader category? Visualize a Venn diagram, even if the edges are fuzzy.

4. **Causes and effects**  What does stock do? What causes it to do that? What doesn‚Äôt it do? When is it used?

5. **Significance and implications**Why does stock matter? What does it suggest? Make the concept personally meaningful.

## Litmus tests 
- **False positives:** How might you produce the correct answer without really knowing the information you intend to know? We absolutely dont want to be engaging in pattern matching instead of learning this is especially important for me because im very prone to pattern matching question and answers. 

- **alse negatives:** How might you know the information the prompt intends to capture but _fail_ to produce the correct answer? Such failures are often caused by not including enough context. see also [[Rules for Designing Precise Anki Cards#^38e7fe]]

All of these things can be remedied by revising the cards over time and being mindful when doing the reviewing. 

## Leap from theory to practice
Q: To help keep my freezer full of chicken stock, I'll make sure to ??? instead of ??? when buying chicken. 

Just because you can answer a factual question about an idea, that doesn‚Äôt mean the idea will spontaneously occur to you when it‚Äôs useful. I don‚Äôt have a well-grounded understanding of the difference, but in my experience, context-laden prompts (like the example at the start) help the leap from theory to practice. I suspect this is another reason it‚Äôs important to densely connect new ideas to old ones, as we did in the conceptual knowledge section: roughly speaking, more connections means more opportunities to trigger new knowledge.
