## Important points
Nervous system is essentially trying to link outside and inside perceptions with each other and make sure that they are in tune with each other. 

impatience is when your internal metronome (think of when you are say stressed in a long line and you feel like it is taking forever, but some other time you have had a great day and the fact that there is a line does not bother you) is ticking faster then you perceive the world around you to be moving. There is in other words a mismatch between your internal state and the way you perceive the outside world. Feeling overwhelmed is the inverse of this. 

The gateway to changing your brain is through deep focus and deep sleep. change is triggered by focus and happens during sleep. 

The amount of focus is directly linked to how successful you are at something. And the reward system is 100% internal. 

Self-reward the effort process is extremely important. Recognise struggle and hardship in the beginning as the first steps of the process of where you want to go. And then reward yourself for any milestone that you reach.  DO NOT get attached to external rewards. 

The ability to push through the paint points is something that generalise very well to other endeavours as well later. 

It is important to realise that when we are facing something big and we feel stress we may interpret it as fear and this will stop us from moving forward and make us freeze. So for example by overanalysing a situation or something like this. The stress that we feel is there to make us move and move towards facing the threat. So if it is not enough with the stress that we are feeling it is not the correct thing to calm ourselves but rather to increase the stress so much that we have no choice but finally moving. For example deadlines are very effective at this. Stress is there to get us to move forward. 

Two categories of people. Those that are not motivated enough these people would benefit from rapid breathing like the wim hoff method to raise their adrenaline levels which would the mimic that agitation they need to feel, this will then get them to move, i.e take action. This can be done through 25-30 rapid breaths in from the nose and out through the mouth then one final deep exhale and hold. Or an ice-bath does this too. 

Those that are too agitated to focus instead need to calm themselves down. What they should do is a deep breath in, followed by another small breath in before a slow exhale. This is called physiological sighs. 

The diagram is an amazing muscle which we can control that gives us access to manipulate the nervous system. 

Mental focus follows visual focus. 

While it is important to have deep focus it is also good for the brain to give it moments of decompression. This can be achieved majorly through sleep but also just walking to the kitchen as a break or something like this. Also the brain and nervous system become very relaxed and rejuvenated when we are walking ,running or just traveling through space. 

## Discussion points
The brain can change in adulthood as much as when you where a kid but you need sharp focus. The way this change of the brain circuitry can work is that nucleus basalis in the brain releases acetylcholine which marks the neurons that where involved in the period of heavy focus, so that the brain and body knows to save them and rearrange them during sleep later. 

The reason it is hard to focus or when we decide that we want to learn something and we feel that initial resistance is because the circuitry that is going to lead to the release of acetylcholine is the same as our stress circuitry. So we feel uneasy and agitated initially. 

This agitation is happening through the release if norepinephrine. The adult brain does not want to change algos it learned when it was young. 

The way to utilize this fact is to bring a lot of thought and attention (i.e focus) to a behaviour or thought or action pattern and most importantly there has to be a sense of urgency. Like you die if you dont solve this equation in the most extreme case. 


The early stages of hard work and focus is going to feel like stress and confusion. None would expect to walk in the gym and do a PR the brain needs to warm up too. There is a period of agitation and stress that is necessary on a mechanistic level in order to go deeper.

So the combination of norepinephrine and acetylcholine together with the release of dopamine is the perfect environment for reinforcing a new behaviour and getting really really good at something. Because you will feel good and each time you feel good you will also improve since you will be so focused and those changes will be marked in your brain by the acetylcholine so that during deep rest your brain will save the connections of those neurons.

The agitation and stress when you try to learn something is something that you need to just accept and get through to get to the dopamine and actually starting to gain deep focus and start the cycle that feeds off of itself. So the the idea is that we dont want set a huge abstract goal but rather we want to set small goals that we can get some kind of internal calibration so that this system of internal reward is going to kick and actually help us rewire the brain. 

Dont fight the brain. Introduce positive and useful thoughts instead thats what we can do. Its very very hard to control which thoughts come up in the brain.

Self-reward the effort process is extremely important. Recognise struggle and hardship in the beginning as the first steps of the process of where you want to go. And then reward yourself for any milestone that you reach. 

 When we are really struggling it can be helpful to reframe the situation and say well at least im still in the race and doing x and then slowly from there utilise the positive feedback loop. Then if we manage to do this we will get some dopamine which pushes back that adrenaline response and this is the brain saying that yes we are on the right path and we are allowed to continue, because otherwise it would keep releasing norepinephrine until we reach the threshold for where we lose cognitive control over our motor systems and are forced to give up. 
 
## Dopamine
Main role is to be released when you reach a milestone or when you think you are on the right path. So we want to link up the dopamine release with a process in our focus i.e the path and or outcome so that we can get those dopamine hits when we are on the right path and or when we have a good outcome.

What dopamine does is that it creates a buffer by lower in the amount of norepinephrine that accumulates in the body from the struggle/suffering of the task at hand. Because norepinephrine acts as a rate limiter in how much suffering/struggle we can tolerate before we just quit. The autonomous nervous system will at a sufficiently high level just kick and make you quit if this threshold is met. 



## Focus
The definition of Focus: When we say focus what we mean is that the brain starts a set of programs that it uses to answer three main questions.
- Duration, how long is this going to last.
- Path, whats going to happen
- Outcome, what is eventually going to happen in the end.
