The core idea of being rational is not to simply be logical. But rather it is your capacity for detecting and correcting self-deception and also your ability to self actualise. 

Not that Aristotles idea of the character is a development of Plato's psyche model. Where we need to get ourselves in order first. The second part of the equation so to speak is this meta drive which we have, which is to be in contact with reality.

For Aristotle, to truly know something is to become one with it. This means that for example someone that can make a chair knows much more about chairs than someone that can merely describe it. Because the chair maker has the structure and the essence/blueprint of the entire process in his mind. For Aristotle knowing and being one with are not separate. 

To have a world view is to have some beliefs of how reality is and confirming these beliefs through knowing more about the world and then using rational thought to make sure that that which you think you know, is actual knowledge that holds up in reality and not an instance of self-deception. So we have two processes that together constitutes a world view. 

Now to abstract out some useful ideas and patterns, we will call the act of gaining knowledge and processing it as being an agent. And we will call the world or the sum total of the beliefs one has as the arena. So what the agent can do is constrained by the arena. and to be a good agent is doing that which makes the most sense and has the most meaning in that arena. For example a tennis player on a football field is just absurd and makes no sense, that is to be a agent that is doing self-deception in the arena which is the football field.

This agent and arena coupling is called co-identification. Because the identity of the arena determines the identity of the agent and vice versa. The football field allows the football player to be a football player and them being a football player makes sense of why this particular place in the world (the football field) is structured the way it is. 

So we are always assigning an arena and assuming agency. So when one is giving a lecture we are assuming the agency of a lecturer and assigning everything around us an identity which facilites the goals that we have once we have assumed the agency of whatever it is we have assumed. This process of co-identification of agent and arena is called an existential-mode. These existential-modes are by extension meta-meaning relations. This means that if you do not have the agent arena relationship then none of your actions have meaning. This means that in the existential-mode of a football player on football field kick the ball in some direction etc has meaning because there is this relationship between agent and arena.

At the bottom of it all, or lets say at ground zero, there are two existential-modes. Having mode and being mode.
* The Having mode is about having stuff and fullfilling the needs of being hungry, thirsty etc. Its categorical, we divide things into groups and sub groups. We can control and manipulate the things around us to fullfil the needs that we have. In this mode we have I - it relationships. Predominantly we are using our intelligence to solve problems in this mode
* The being mode is about our being needs. Here its not categorical but expressive. its about our need to become something, to grow and develop we have I - thou relationships instead. We dont manipulate and control but rather we are acting as feedback cycles with others in our environment. Predominately using reason to make meaning.

Very important to understand that it is not that one is good and the other is bad. The point is that we get mixed up and try to fullfil our being needs from within the having mode. we want to grow and develop so we buy a new car etc. In other words we are suffering from modal confusion. A big part of advertisment is about trying to confuse you so that you try to pursue being need in having mode. You need to be mature, here is a car etc etc.
