The flow state the human beings experience is apparently not only a great feeling but also a state in which we generate our most profound insights and our best work. Furthermore people that experience the flow state more often than others report a higher sense of meaning in their life. 

People are really good a discovering patterns unconsciously. A lot of psychic abilities that people say they have, have been show to simply be that they have discovered some kind of complex pattern. 

Intuition is the result of implicit learning. 

Metaphors are very powerful for our cognition. Metaphors are the way in which we make creative connections between ideas. 

We dont read the stuff from ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it does not speak to or we dont relate to it as much as we do to texts and ideas from  800 b.ce to 300 b.ce. This period is called the Axial age. Something happened here that is formative to us. One of the most important changes or discoveries of this period is alphabetic literacy. Another one is coins and thus the need for numerical thinking. 

Second order thinking is the act of incorporating a psycho technology to improve your own metacognition(being aware of/ being able to think about your thinking) through critical examination of your current way of thinking/ cognition. 

Now we have people being trained in symbolic and abstract thinking through dealing with money at the same time as there is an increase in second order thinking through the spread of literacy, now there are power ful psycho mechanisms ready for exaptation( evolutionary term for where something that was evolved starts being used for other things than it was originally evolved for, think about our tongue. It was evolved as a poison detector but is not mostly used for speaking). The result here is that people start to see the errors in the way they are thinking. They dont see chaos and war and suffering as the natural order of things but rather they start to see that they are responsible for their actions and that those actions are reflected in how their environment is.
