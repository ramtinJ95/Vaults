## Discussion
**Immediate goal based habits**: designed to bring a specific outcome each time we do them. example doing cardio 3 times a week. 
**Identity based habits**: here we want to become say a "fit person". we are linking working out to a larger goal in this case. 

The time it takes to form a habit could be anywhere from 18 to 254 days. The major factor at work here is how good a person is at overcoming two states within themselves. The first state is that one is too anxious and thus cannot calm themselves enough to engage in the activity and the other is a state where one is feeling unmotivated and a lack of energy. Andrew Huberman calls this Limbic friction.

 **Habit strength** : Measured in two ways. How context dependent a habit is. i.e do we brush our teeth the same time if we are not at home. The other way is how much limbic friction it takes to execute the habit. 

 **tool 1**: use procedural memory to lower limbic friction. This means that we should think through the sequence of steps required in order to perform this habit from start to finish. 
 The mechanism responsible for tool one is:
	 Hebbian learning is when particular neuron fire together and thus they become stronger together. NMDA recepters are on the neurons surface. When a strong input to the neuron the NMDA brings more recepters to the neuron surface which makes it more likely to fire.

**tool 2**: task bracketing. this is the stuff that takes place just before and after the habit itself. 
The mechanism responsible for tool two is:
	basal ganglia, action suppression and activation, no-go and go signal. dorsal lateral stratum is associated with the actions before and after a habit. It acts like a marker for the habit excitation but not the habit execution itself. 

timing of the day of when we want to create a new habit is not important. The state in which the mind/nervous system is in, is much more important. 

**tool 3**: divide 24h into 3 phases
* **phase 1**: 0-8 hours after waking up. During this phase adrenaline and noradrenaline and dopamin levels are elevated. workout and cold shower and fasting great for this phase. Thyrosine is a precursor to dopamine. Can supplement with ,alpha gpc, l-tyracine .At this time we have good alertness and focus and thus tasks that take a lot of limbic friction are easier to do. Doing this and doing the same tasks within the same phases day makes it easier to use task bracketing, since the nervous system will learn when we lean in a bit extra to overcome limbic friction. 
* **phase 2**: 9-15 hours after waking up. dopamine and adrenaline tend to come down in this phase. Serotonin is starting to rise. Tends to lends itself to a calmer state. Taper of the amount of really bright light at this point of the day. Actually bringing the lights physically lower triggers the brain to relax more since the neurons that register light from above tells us that the sun is up and we need to be alert. We want depress kortisol at this phase of the day since high kortisol at this point leads to anxiety and depression.  Habits like journaling, learning a language, reading is a perfect for phase 2.  Ability to override limbic friction is quite low at this point. If one works out at this phase it is very beneficial to perform a non sleep deep relaxation session after the workout within one hour. Because this will bring down the excitation of the nervous-system and allow one to smoothly transition into phase 3. 
* **phase 3**:16-24 hours after waking up. Very low to no light. Room temperature low. 

Once the habit is there we want to move it around in the day so that it becomes context independent which is the goal. 

**tool 4**: Think about the events before and after the habit. So say you are going for a run, think about how hard it is going to be in the beginning but also think about good you will feel after. Reward yourself subjectively for the entire experience and not only the habit itself. So in other words we want to reward the entire task bracket. So here we want to enforce the fact that we should not just think about the habit itself and all the steps associated with it, but rather we should think through the steps of events before and after the habit.

**tool 5**: The framework or system for how to build and test the habits.
Pick 6 habits that you want to form. Try to perform them all but expect to only be able to do 4 or 5 of them each day. Do this for 21 days. Then for 21 days after this first 21 day episode, just observe yourself and see which habits stuck and which did not. After this total of 42 days then try to again for 21 focus on performing the habits of the original 6 that did not stuck and so on and so forth. Only once all the 6 habits have become reflexive and context independent should one think about adding a new set of 6 habits and repeating the process. Of course you want to think about how to align the habits you want to acquire with the phases during the day and using the other tools. If you miss one day you just get back to it the next day, without overcompensating for the missed day. One of the reason for not doing all the habits everyday is that some habits are not good to do everyday like weight training etc. 

Overall it is important to have a routine that we can do consistently for 5-6 days without fail because nothing generates results like consistency.
