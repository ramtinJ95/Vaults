Before the Axial age humans had the world view of continuous cosmos where everything was essentially connected. And you could have things like actually thinking that the Pharos where god kings since they had so much more power and influence on the world compared to the average citizen of the time.

With the Axial age we instead have a dual world view. Where we have one world which is the everyday world where we have self-deception and war and chaos and suffering, and the other world is the real world. To perceive the real world you need wisdom and a trained mind. This is quite close to Jungs idea of the spirit of the times VS the spirit of the depths. 

The Gods before the Axial age and by extension the great disembedding(The great disembedding is this idea where our myths changed from being cyclic to being what we know them as today where they are stories with a beginning and an end, a motive and direction) where tied to a place and/or a function, we had god a thieves, god of weaving god of sun etc. But the Hebrew is a god of future potential, the hebrew god does not have a name because giving something a name is to tie to a place and time. When asked for his name by moses the hebrew god says i will be what i will be, i am the god of the open future. Even this is quite close to what Jung is saying about the internal divine child as your god if you have managed to become developed.

The idea of the religions that build upon the hebrew god is that humans are here in this world and they are moving towards the promised land. To be good and have faith originally means that you are aware of yourself enough such that you are moving towards, i.e progressing, the promised land. And to sin simply originally meant that you are of course, you are not longer on the path that leads to the promised land. And this can be because of any reason but from time to time god needs to intervene to get you back on the right course, and thus we have prophets. Super important to note is also that faith from the beginning was not to belive in nonsense without proof but to being a part of actually progressing yourself and your environment towards the promised land.
