# Formulating Knowledge for spaced repetition

1. There is absolutely no point in trying to memorise something you dont understand. 

2. Do not try and memorize loosely connected facts. Read the entire chapter then start making questions for yourself either from your notes or from the stuff you want to remember from that chapter. AFTER you have an understanding of how some of the stuff are connected 

3. Memorize the basics. Dont do this that oh this is so basic I will remember it etc, because if that is the case then you wont be spending that much time on it anyway, but if you forget some of the basics then it will really cost you.

4. We want to stick to the atomic information principle. Which means that one flashcard for one thing. Two important principles are: A) simple is easy. B) Repetitions of simple items are easier to schedule. Below is a good example of these to principles ![[Screenshot 2021-04-21 at 16.30.58.png]]

5. Cloze deletion discussed here [[Anki#^2158df]] is easy and effective and the picture form of this is also highly effective [[Anki#^b68c12]]

6. Use images where possible to accompany the questions in the cards since this makes it much easier to remember and also gives much more context to the question or fact/idea/concept we are trying to learn/memorize

7. Avoid sets and enumarations, ie sequentially learning many things. For example if we want to learn the alphabet its hard to answer "what is the sequence of alphabets" A: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. Instead ask stuff like "Fill out the missing letters of the alphabet A ... ... ... E" A: B,C,D etc . Here is a good example of what to do instead for sets: ![[Screenshot 2021-04-21 at 16.35.38.png]]


8. We want simple wording, i.e we dont want to be writing to many words in our questions so that we dont lose specificity of the thing we are trying to memorise. To help with this its smart to give the context, tex what is memory refering to in CS, instead of having what is memory and the answer being RAM.

9. Some redundancy in the cards is actually beneficial since it allow for different angles to the same facts. Also it can be good to have the answers to some questions as a card but at the same time have the card ask for the solution or process of ending up with that answer as a card to, so that we know where we are going fast and then also how we get there. For math it is even good to just straight up memorize some derivation steps too speed up calculations or even more importantly reasoning.
