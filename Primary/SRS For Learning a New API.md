# SRS For Learning a New API
First I need to have a project where im going to use the API. Then I should just do a quick skim through a tutorial or the documentation but nothing more, no deep dives yet. After the skim, find a small piece of code that does something related to some core functionality of the project. Get this code running. Then start doing small tweaks to the code.

while doing these small tweaks we will be looking up stuff in the docs/stackoverflow/tutorials. Once we find stuff that we seem to use a lot or if there is a central concept then we make anki cards for it.

Once we have made some progress on the project and we are sure the API is suitable for our project then we can go through a tutorial properly. One important note is that on the first pass through of the material we should ankify lightly because we dont know how stuff fits together, but on the second pass we have more context and can thus be sure we will commit quality stuff to our memory. 

I continue doing this, bouncing back and forth between working on my project and working on Anki as I make my way through tutorials and documentation, as well as material that comes up while reading code ‚Äì code from others, and even code I've written myself. I find it surprisingly helpful to Ankify the APIs for code I've personally written, if they're likely to be useful in the future. Just because I wrote something doesn't mean I'll remember it in future!

So: don't jump into Ankifying tutorials and documentation straight away. Wait, and do it in tandem with serious work on your project
