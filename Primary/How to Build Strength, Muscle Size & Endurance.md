#### Principles 9 
adaptations you get from exercise:  
1. Skill.  
2. Speed. 
3. Power = speed * strength  
4. Strength.  
5. Hypertrophy (muscle size).  
6. Muscular endurance.  
7. Anaerobic power (ability to produce a lot of work for 30sec-2min).  
8. Vo2 max anaerobic power (ability to produce a lot of work for 6‚Äì12min).  
9. Long duration endurance. 
It is the application of an exercise that is going to determine what will be the adaptation, not the exercise per se. 

#### Progressive overload 
-If you do the exact same workout every time forever, you are not going to add additional stress.

-So, you need to progressively overload your workouts. 

-How to overload? Do a combination of: Add more weights, more reps, more sets, more complexity to the movement, more workouts overall.

Modifiable variables 
-Modifiable variables are the things you can modify in the workout that will change the outcome.  
	‚Ä¢ Exercise choice.  
	‚Ä¢ Intensity: measured by percentage of one rep max or percentage of max Heart rate.  
	‚Ä¢ Volume: how many reps and sets.  
	‚Ä¢ Rest intervals. 
	‚Ä¢ Progression.
	
#### How to train for STRENGTH: 
-Exercise choice: 
	‚Ä¢ Choose exercise that have a full range of motion. 
	‚Ä¢ For upper body: push and pull exercises, both vertically and horizontally. Example: Bench press (push horizontally); Shoulder press (push vertically); Barbell row (pull horizontally); Pull ups (pull vertically).  
	‚Ä¢ Lower body: push exercises (squats) and pull (deadlift).
	
-To activate the higher threshold neurons you need to demand the muscle to produce more FORCE. 

-The only way to develop strength is to challenge the muscle to produce more force. -The primary driver for strength is Intensity.

-THREE TO FIVE CONCEPT:  
	‚Ä¢ Pick 3 to 5 exercises.  
	‚Ä¢ Do 3 to 5 reps at 85% of one rep max.  
	‚Ä¢ Do 3 to 5 sets. 
	‚Ä¢ Do 3 to 5min rest.  
	‚Ä¢ Perform workout 3 to 5 times a week. 
	
-Training Frequency: In training for strength, you don‚Äôt induce much damage. Strength is not causing a lot of soreness. Therefore frequency can be as high as you want. Power lifters train squats everyday. But if you are not a pro (most likely you are not, just like me), twice a week is absolutely fine for developing strength. 

#### How to train for HYPERTROPHY 
-Rep range: five to thirty reps per set. You have to take it to muscular failure (extreme failure is not necessary). 

-Rest intervals: between 1‚Äì2mins. 

-Three drivers for hypertrophy:  
	‚Ä¢ Metabolic stress: it‚Äôs the ‚Äúburn‚Äù.  
	‚Ä¢ Mechanical tension: heavy loads.  
	‚Ä¢ Muscular damage: more damage is not better. 
	
-The primary driver for hypertrophy is Volume.

-Note: Soreness is a terrible metric for the quality of a workout. 

-Training Frequency: you need to hedge towards recovery. Because what you do is cause a massive damage in the muscle to then allow the protein synthesis to occur, we need to rest (building new tissue requires approx. 72hs). So, wait at least 48hs before hitting the same muscle group. 

-There is a relationship between muscle size and strength, but it is not 1:1. Body builders are not stronger than power lifters, even though they have more muscle. But body builders are stronger than most people. Mind to muscle connection & Mental awareness

-Using a mind-muscle connection refers to focusing our attention on the muscle that is working during a set of strength training exercise. 

-To get stronger focus on moving weights. 

-For hypertrophy, focus on challenging muscles (still with proper form). 

-Intentionality matters: the intent to move is more important than the actual movement velocity. 

-Mind to muscle connection enhances hypertrophy. 

-Eccentric overload is an effective way to activate a muscle. 

-Eccentrics are also good for strength and hypertrophy. 

#### Breathing 
-Simple rule of thumb: Exhale on the effort and inhale on the lesser effort. Breathing in between and after the workout 

-Huge area of potential benefit, as after workouts is when neuroplasticity works.

-Down regulation strategy: you need to give the body the signal that the workout is done and it‚Äôs ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. This strategies enhance rate of recovery. 

-After workouts: do something that calms you down for five minutes. 
For example, Breaths strategies: 
	‚Ä¢ 1:2 inhale-exhale ratio (For example, inhale for 4 secs, exhale for 8).  
	‚Ä¢ Box breathing.  
	‚Ä¢ Triangle Breathing. 
	
#### Endurance 
-Exercise choice: needs to be concerned with eccentric landing. Running has a much more eccentric load than cycling or swimming because you are putting all the weight in one foot at a time. So running is not the best choice if you are a beginner. 

-Generic recommendation for overall health:150 to 180 minutes of zone 2 cardio. 

-There is no interference effect: Zone 2 cardio doesn‚Äôt inhibit ANY of the gains or ability for strength and hypertrophy. It might even help.

-Frequency: daily. -TIP: Do something once a week that gets you to maximum (or really close) heart rate. (Example: 90 seconds burpees to death, sprints, or whatever gets your heart getting to max rate). 

-Generally used formula for Max heart rate = 220-years old. However, this is not a good proxy. A good way to do calculate your max heart rate is simply doing an extremely demanding workout, and check what was your maximum heart rate (if you don‚Äôt have a fitness tracker, you can measure it manually). Muscular endurance 

-Building muscular endurance can increase whole-body strength, improve your posture, and reduce your risk of injuries. 

-The goal of muscular endurance training is to perform more reps or keep a muscle group active for a longer period of time. 

-Muscular endurance is important for general maintenance of joint health.

-Fast twitch muscle fibers tend to be bigger and fatigable. Slow twitch muscle fibers tend to be smaller and are better at burning fat. 

-Muscular endurance helps slow twitch muscle fibers maintain their working job. 

-Muscular endurance exercises: Farmer‚Äôs Walk and Loaded Carries, Planks, Wall Sits. Hydration 

-Throughout the day: drink half your bodyweight (in pounds) in ounces per day. So, 200 pounds ‚Üí 100 ounces of water. 

-Galpin equation for knowing how much water to drink during exercise: Bodyweight (in pounds)/30 = Ounces for every 15 minutes of exercise. 

-Sweat testing: to know how much sodium is on sweat. This is a good indicator of how much water you need. How to measure it? Gatorade patches. 

-Pre hydration: 5‚Äì6 ounces of water.

-Salt: 500mg salt before and 500mg salt after workout. If it is a really long workout (or if it is very hot or humid weather): 300mg of salt during workout. Cold Exposure 

-Getting into an ice bath immediately after a hypertrophy session is detrimental. Don‚Äôt do it.

-How long to wait after hypertrophy session? Four hours. 

-However, it is not as big a concern for strength. 

-For endurance training, data is not super clear, but it does seem to be beneficial. 

-Cold shower is not the same as an ice bath or even cold immersion. Heat Exposure 

-You can enhance hypertrophy by getting in the sauna for 20 minutes after hypertrophy training session. 

-Sauna (180F‚Äì220F ‚Äî 82‚Äì104Celcius) is GREAT but it is not substitute for exercise. 

-Make sure you are hydrated before you enter the sauna, and also re-hydrate after. Recovery 

-Anytime the total stress load outpaces recovery capacity you are reducing your physical ability or adaptability. 

-The best thing is to implement the most stress possible (driver of adaptation) and recover from that. 

-To measure your recovery:  
1. Grip strength test  
2. Carbon dioxide tolerance test: four deep slow breaths in thru the nose and out thru the nose, and then a big inhale and max exhale. Time the duration of the exhale thru the nose. If the exhale last 60 seconds approx. it means you are fully recovered. 
		‚Ä¢ Do it upon waking.  
3. Finger Tap test. There are apps. 

#### SUPPLEMENTS 
-Sodium bicarbonate Sodium bicarbonate can put you in a more alkaline state. So you delay the progression of fatigue. How to use it? Start with a half a teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate prior to a workout (20‚Äì60min before). 

-Beta alanine Delays the buildup of acid = is a fatigue blocker.

-CREATINE MONOHYDRATE: THE TOP SUPPLEMENT Creatine is a substance that is found naturally in muscle cells. It helps your muscles produce energy during heavy lifting or high-intensity exercise. It helps your body produce more of a high-energy molecule called ATP. When you have more ATP, your body can perform better during exercise. Creatine also alters several cellular processes that lead to increased muscle mass, strength and recovery. Other health benefits:  
	‚Ä¢ Lowers blood sugar levels  
	‚Ä¢ Improves muscle function and quality of life in older adults  
	‚Ä¢ Helps treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.  
	‚Ä¢ May reduce symptoms and slow the progression of some neurological diseases.
