# Drilling down Speed up learning

## Speeding up understanding
1. Making connections. Here we are after insights or some connection we make regarding the subject we are trying to learn. For example for me learning that the clutch of a car actually controls the power from the engine to the wheels is what got me to finally being able to drive manual such aha moments.

2. Debugging errors. Here the idea is that we have misconceptions or even missing knowledge or poor understanding about the subject and this should be done swiftly

To do these two simple things well Scott proposes the following methodology.

## DrillDown Method
1. Coverage
2. Practice
3. Insight

It is very important to note that this process is not something that happens just once, but rather it happens many times in cycles. I find that this makes sense if i think about learning for example the contents of a chapter in some book. First read through it fast and make some notes as in **stage one**. Then practice those concepts and methods taught in that chapter and even reference your notes but note down which things did not stick well, this would be **stage two**. Finally try to write about the chapter with Feynmans technique to see which parts really stuck with you and which parts need revision this is **stage three**.   

### Stage one: Coverage
When trying to learn anything we cant know what to attack if we dont have a map. So the first step should always be to get a general overview of what it is that we need to learn. So in practice this could mean to go through the lectures or reading the course book or reading many books.

An Idea here is to take sparse notes while reading or doing a one-paragraph summary after reading each major section. Highlighting and stuff like that is just a waste of time.

### Stage two: Practice
If you want to learn you 100% need immediate feedback. One of the most effective ways of doing this is to solve problems and then compare them to the solution.

Note that practice problems should be used for areas that we need to develop a better intuition for and not be grinded forever or too much.

### Stage three: Insight
The goal of stage 1 and 2 is to get you to a point where we know what we dont understand. Here the main tool or method for doing this will be Feynmans technique.

#### Feynman's Technique
The main idea of the method is taking a big idea which we dont understand and breaking it into smaller chunks and by learning all the small chunks we will eventually fill in the gaps that is stopping us from learning the big idea that we wanted to learn in the first place. 

1. Get a paper
2. Write at the top the idea or process you want to learn
3. Explain the idea as if you where teaching to someone else.

It is possible that the third step leads to you having to repeat ideas you understand already but eventually once you keep going you will get stuck and where you get stuck is exactly where there is a gap in knowledge. Some tips 

- **For Ideas You Dont Get At All**
	- You can still do this but have the textbook open. Then go through very carefully and copy the authors explanation but also try to elaborate and clearify it for yourself.

- **For Procedures**
	- Go through all the steps and explain not only what they do but how they excetue what they are doing. For example going thorugh a proof technique by carefully explaining all the steps

- **For Formulas**
	- Formulas should be understood not memorized. Try walking through each part of a formula with the Feynman method, for example take the bellman equation in reinforcment learning, it would be smart to write it at the top and then explaing each component of the equation and where they come from to get a deep understanding of it

This method also checks your memory if you try to explain something and do it without looking at your notes or any reference material, if you can explain it well and clearly then you can be sure that you both understand and remember it. 

The last bonus step is that once you have gained a basic understanding the next step is to go further and see if you can explain the idea using:
1.  **Analogies** ‚Äì You understand an idea by correctly recognizing an important similarity between it and an easier-to-understand idea.

2.  **Visualizations** ‚Äì Abstract ideas often become useful intuitions when we can form a mental picture of them. Even if the picture is just an incomplete representation of a larger, and more varied, idea.

3.  **Simplifications** ‚Äì A famous scientist once said that if you couldn‚Äôt explain something to your grandmother, you don‚Äôt fully understand it. Simplification is the art of strengthening those connections between basic components and complex ideas.
