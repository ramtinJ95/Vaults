damage to the cerabellum leads to ataxia which is a disorder that makes it so that fast movments are not possible and all other movements are very slow and choppy

Purkinje cell. at min 51 in the lecture there is a picture with the title cerebellar circuits. Purinkinje cell are inhibitory. Minute 104 in the presentation has a clear schematic of the neuronal circutriy that show also which one is excitery and ihbitory and so on. The same picture is in the text book at page 9 chapter 19 with an explanatory text. page 11 also has some good stuff in it.
