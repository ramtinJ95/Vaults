In the introduction John says that thanks to some kind of near extinction event happening 70k years ago humans adapted to this through a social technology which we now know as trade Because that allowed us to have access to more resources then is available locally and also come in contact with new discoveries and ideas. But to be able to live in large groups where you cannot possibly know all the people we had to develop a second social technology which is rituals, and we humans have rituals for everything even though we may not even be aware of them anymore. For example when you meet someone you reach out your hand and shake it up and down. You do this almost subconsciously now but when it was invented it was for us to able to see if they have weapons or if they are tense etc etc.  This also allowed us to be able to learn how to move from our own first person perspective and enter into the the mind state of someone else, i.e third person view. This greatly enhanced our cognitive capabilities.
