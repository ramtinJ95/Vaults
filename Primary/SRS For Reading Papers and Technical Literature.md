# SRS For Reading Papers and Technical Literature

Say I want to learn the content of a paper. First read it a couple of times not looking for comprehensive understanding but instead trying to do two things:
- Look for basic facts that I can learn easily, this means stuff like name of the methods used, basic terminology
- Identify the key ideas, like what is the main methods used etc stuff that I think i will have to learn more about

I will then do this a couple of times and each time the space of stuff that is understood should increase.

After these shallow reads there will be two thorough reads where the aim is comprehensive understanding.

What is very important to note is that using SRS systems seem to work much better when the stuff we are trying to remember is then used in some kind of real world process.

When reading a paper it is good to aim for between 5 - 20 anki cards. These questions should be about core claims, ideas or questions within the paper. One important principle to remember here is that we dont want to memorize wrong claims or misleading statements in papers. In order to avoid this we also add to our memory the source of the paper as the following example:
- What does Jones 2011 claim is the average age at which physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery, over 1980-2011?‚Äù (Answer: 48). Another variant question was: ‚ÄúWhich paper claimed that physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery at average age 48, over the period 1980-2011?‚Äù (Answer: Jones 2011). And so on. ^cff067

In the example above is another technique used that is very useful and that is to have different variants of the same question that test for different parts of the knowledge we wish to commit to memory.

If I want to immerse myself in a field and need to "read" and understand a big chunk of the current literature. To do this we want to repeat the process above for 5 - 10 of the best papers of that field. This reading should then be supplemented with more shallow reads of other papers, this number of shallow reads should preferably be between 10-50 papers. So by shallow reads i mean doing the first step of the process described above and only go deeper if we think there is some value to doing that. Over time this approach is a form of synoptic reading (term coined by Mortimer adler). This means to build up and understanding of an entire literature: What's been done, whats not been etc. It is not the same as reading the entire literature but in practice pretty close.
