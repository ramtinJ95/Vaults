## Areas of Reference
000s - [[000 Index]]
010s - [[010 Productivity]]
020s - [[020 Family Life]]
030s - [[030 Software Development]]
040s - [[040 Science]]

So the idea is that these references are representing my major focus areas in life. Then within those reference notes there will be MOCs. MOC is short for maps of content which is essentially a curation of content within a reference. In other words it will show me where some good jump of points could be within for example productivity in case i want to think more about some topic within productivity. 


I will be using tags for status and type of note for now, I think that will be the most useful system for it, maybe even use emojis as tags. The "tags" will be links so that MOC's can emerge and this will give structures over time. The conventional idea for a tag will be used for status

tags: 
	- #🌳 this is the evergreen notes, this means that notes with this symbol are fleshed out and will always give value when i read them even years after they are written
	- #🗺 MOC for notes that are maps of content
	- #🌱 New ideas and notes that are not done yet or need more fleshing out
	- #
