## Important points
When trying to learn something new we want to use the 85 % rule. Which means that we successed 85% of the time. So if we are doing 10 math questions we want to get about 6-8 of them right and be okej making 4-2 mistakes. In fact we should aim for making at least 2 mistakes others what we are doing is too easy, and if we are doing 5 or more mistakes then what we are trying to do is too hard at that point in time.
