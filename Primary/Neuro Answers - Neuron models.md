 1) Assuming the neuron is at resting membrane potential(RMP) then to begin with sodium is important because it will flow into the cell once some kind of neurostimulator say tex glutamate binds to ligand gated ion channels and open them up. once these channels are open positive ions such as sodium and calcium can flow into the cell. this is called epsp. Once these epsp have accumulated enough so that we reach threshold potential then we have the next step of the story.
 
 through the accumalation of epsp's we have now reached TP. Now there are voltage gated sodium channels, perticulary activation gates that are on the outside of the neuron,that are sensitive to this -55 mv and they now get permieable to sodium. Sodium thus flows into the cell and depolarizes it to +30 mv and this happens down the axon like a chain. 
 
 2) If there are only na+ ion channels then we cannot hyperpolorize the channel after making it fire once since the potasium channels are so important for the neuron to be able to go back to RMP so that we can restart this process again. This is know as the refactory period of the neuron. So if there are only na+ channels then this "recharge" process cannot occur and no matter how strong stimuli we apply we cannot make it fire again. 

3) Voltage clamp is how to measure this. Time constant is a way of measuring how quickly a neurons voltage level decays back to its RMP after its fired.
 
4) Generating action potential is a three part story
	1) RMP. Here there are three different process that keep the -70mv RMP. First we have the sodium potasium pumps in the neuron membrane which throw out sodium and take in potasium. Then we have leaky potasium channels which leak out alot of potasium. Lastly we have leaky sodium channels which take in some sodium. Note that the permeable channels for potassium are many times more permeable than the sodium channels and are the reason for the negative resting potential of the neuron.
	2) Gradient potential. This is how the potential that is required to get to threshold is generated. So at this stage there could be some kind of exciteroy neurotransmitter such as glutamate that binds to ligand gated ion channels. This then leads to these channels allowing sodium and calcium iones to come into the cell and depolorize the cell. This is what is called epsp, ie exciteory post synaptic potential, this is what makes the neuron go from RMP to TP.
	3) When the neuron reaches TP then there are voltage gated sodium channels that are sensitive to the TP and particulary the activation channels that then let through sodium channels. This depolorizes the neuron even further so that it goes from -55 to +30. Right behind this wave we have a bunch of potassium leaking out of the cell since the new voltage +30 activates the voltage gated potassium channels which hyperpolorize the neuron all the way back down to -90 mv.

5) for this one, i will have to look at the equations

6) The threshold is the voltage needed for the action potential response in a neuron to fire off. This can be measured using a voltage clamp setup. 

7) Answer for this one is in chapter 2 page 41
