 
Through Socrates and the Axial revolution gods become moral exemplar so that they represent that which we has humans should reach for.

Know thy self that is inscribed at the delphi oracle sight does not mean what we think of it today. It is not about stroking your ego and thinking that you are somehow special or different from others, in other words in not about an auto biography. Rather it is more like an owners manual. It is to know how you work, what are your constraints, how does your mind and other functions within you operate.

Thales was a natural philosopher that essentially invented scientific thought in a sense. One of his cornerstone philosphies was that "All is the moist". This is very rational since everything around him was essentially made out of water or needed water to survive, so he assumed that the substance of reality should be water. Now this is of course not correct but the beauty in the idea is that he used his rational thought and did not make up a mythological story to come up with an explanation for what he was observing.

Ontology is the study of being, the structure of reality. Ontological analysis is when one uses reason to try and get to the underlying structure of reality.

Natural philosophers may give us facts and truths but this knowledge in of itself does not promote wisdom. And Socrates knew this already back then and thus he did not approve of them. 

In ancient Greece there was another group which had the same influence/power as the natural philosophers and they where the Sophists. This group loved wisdom. And from them came the idea of democracy and rhetoric. For a Sophist the psycho technology of arguing for your point was separate from being moral. So they could tech someone in the morning how to argue for increase of taxation and then in the evening teach someone else how to argue for decrease of taxation. This is the basis for what we today call advertisment. They perfected the art of convincing people of their Pov and making some needs salient. They managed to do this through the very very important discovery that **your beliefs are not the only thing driving you**. 

The concept of bullshit in this series is that we know the reality but we choose or are distracted by other feelings or ideals which may not actually have any basis in truth and or reality. So it is impossible to lie to yourself, but still it is very common to self deceive. Why? Because bullshitting yourself is not the same as lying to yourself. Bullshitting yourself and self deception does **not** have to do with belief. We cannot choose what we belive. But we can direct our attention. That which we pay attention to becomes salient to us, i.e it stands out for us. But not only can we direct our attention, our attention can also be caught by something that is salient to us. The easiest example is that we hear a loud unexpected noise, the source of that noise grabs/catches our attention immediately. Once something becomes super salient to us we direct so much of our attention to it that we lose the capacity to pay attention to other aspects or even notice other things and this is how we bullshit ourselves. So the salience or catchiness of this stimulus has overtaken any concern we have over wether or not it is true or represents reality, this is how we deceive ourselves.  Sophists are the antithesis of the axial revolution. they are promoting not self knowledge but rather self deception and thus by extension they represent bullshit. 

Simply put: Natural philosophers represent truth without relevance and Sophists represent relevance without truth. Socrates wanted both. 

Wanted Socrates realised is that we are all bullshitting ourself about our endeavours all the time. So his answer to the oracle of Delphi saying that the gods have said that socrates is the wises human being is that he knows that which he does not know. What this means is that he understod that we all have goals or aspirations because of reasons which we are not truly understanding of where it comes from or why we have them. Socrates is put on trial and says this as his final rebuttal "the unexamined life is not a life worth living". Now that we know all of this background we realise that what he means is that a worth where there is not considerable effort to have truth and relevance combined and reinforcing each other is void of meaning. 

Reason and love thus should not be separate. We need to rationally know and choose what we should be passionate about.
