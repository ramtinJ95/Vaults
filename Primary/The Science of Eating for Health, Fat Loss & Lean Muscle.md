Exercise is the best biohack there is. All other effects such as good diet, using mnm etc combined does not compare. Even if one does not lose weight it improves all bio markers.

The placebo effect is not only a feeling, but it will actually change your physiology. There was one experiment where people where told that they where being given steroids but where actually not, but still they gained more muscle mass and strength compared to the control group. 

Exercise actually makes you more sensitive to satiation signals that the body produces. So the same signals are always there but through exercise one becomes more sensitive to them, and thus you would actually eat less at the same time that your are increasing your amount of calories burnt from exercise. But it does not mean that you will lose weight. Current studies show that NEAT, i.e fidgeting or other subconscious spontaneous movements, are a major part of energy expenditure. The things is that NEAT decreases very fast when one is in a caloric deficit so just because you start exercising does not mean that you will lose weight, you have to be conscious of all the effects. 

The main part of weight loss is keeping the weight off. So you get to pick the restriction strategy but makes sure that the strategy is something that you can keep at for the rest of your life. Because if your goal is to just lose say 10kg and then when you do lose it, you just go back to old habits, then you will ofc gain it all back. So think super long term but also most, if not all, people that successfully keep weight off says that they had to kill their old self, and that everyday they have to keep steps to keep that other-self at bay. 

There are stretch sensors in the gut, these are called as mechanical sensors, where they send signals of the gut being stretched to the brain, these also help the brain to know when one has eaten enough, or that it should start sending signals of satiation. Very cool stuff.

3 major levers for improving gut health is
* Not eating too many calories
* Exercise
* Fiber, fruit and vegetables, grains, cereals etc 40-50g of fibers  at least 15g per 1000kcal

pre-biotics are much better than probiotics.

High HDL is good.

The most important amino is lucine. In studies where people ate plant based protein vs animal based, the same amount of protein synthesis was managed to be reached by supplementing with lucine.

Carb blockers such as Berberine does not work as weight loss mechanisms. Because even though you will not absorb the carbs in your gut, the carbs will then be transported to your large intestine which will then just turn it into fat in your liver. I.e you will still get the kcals just in a different form.
