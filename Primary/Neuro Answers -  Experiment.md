a) Are we born to see? In order words are we born with some kind of inate model of the world. Or do we learn to see?

b) For this experiement they used kittens who where kept in the dark except for 5 hours a day. During those 5 hours the visual envoirment of the kittens where either only vertical or horizontal strips. After a few months they then stopped this envoirment and put them in a real envioirmont and did some behavioural studies on the kittens. After a couple of months they then did neurophysiologcal exams. Where they measured the prefered orientation of the neurons in the primary visual cortex. 

c) Our ability to see is learned and not something we are born with. The reason they think this is the case is that they did not observe any "silent" regions in the cortex that would suggest that there are neurions which have degenerated because of lack of stimulus. 

d) One assumption that they are making in order to justify their idea that cells may change their preferred orentiation towards that of the common type of stimulus is that they did not observe those silent regions mentioned above and they think that this means that there was no degenaration of certain cortical neurones. But it could be that other parts of the brain got damaged beacuse of this limited stimulus during the formative period in the kittens life.
