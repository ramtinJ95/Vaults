	- Sportspersons regularly react to very fast moving balls. Sensory transmission delay andprocessing time are too long to allow for an animal to act only in response to stimulus. Whatis a possible strategy that biological brains seem to adopt to enable very fast movements inresponse to external stimuli such as hitting a moving tennis ball?
	- There is growing evidence that the brain may be doing something akin to Bayesian inferenceto know the current state (e.g. location of a moving hand while reaching a target). Why doesthe brain need to do so, since it has issued the command and it can see the hand, thereshould not be any need for probabilistic estimation?
	- When you stand in front of a stationary mirror and move your head randomly (as random asa person can be) you can very well see your face in the mirror. By contrast, when you staystationary and the mirror is moved randomly, you are not able to see your face anymore.Why so?
	- What are internal models? Describe the required function of each of the internal models inmotor planning and control.
	- Someone has replaced your computer keyboard where they have changed the forcerequired to press the keys as well the mapping of special characters (e.g. ‘{‘) which requirepressing of ‘shift_key’ + ‘some_other_key’. As you learn to work with this new keyboardwhich internal model would you change and why?
- **Motor coordination**
	- List parts of the nervous system involved in initiation, generation and coordination of themovements.
	- Neurons in the motor cortex are known to be broadly tuned to a specific movement. Eachmotor neuron may control several muscles spanning multiple joints and thus cannot beassociated with any particular movement. How are precise movements possible then?
- **Memory** [[Neuro Answers - Memory]]
	- You are watching a youtube video on the anatomy of memory and they are just discussing theinvolvement of regions XXX, YYY and ZZZ in Q-type of memory when one of your friends phonesyou to ask what time the zoom for the Neuroscience course started this morning (your friend hadforgotten about it). You also get the question of what year Ramon y Cajal received the Nobel prize.After hanging up you realize you have forgotten the names of the three brain regions they hadmentioned so you have to back the video a few minutes. After finishing watching the video, youreward yourself with a short bike-ride in the sunny weather. On the bike, you realize your youngersister has modified it so that you need to pedal backwards to go forwards. Even if you immediatelyunderstand this, it takes several trials over the next week to really get good at biking with thismodified bike. In the beginning, it is very hard, but you get a huge kick each time it works well.
		- What kind of memory system was your brain using for the three brain regions (what is thistype of memory called and what region of the brain is traditionally seen as vital for itsfunction)?
		- What kind of memory type was you using when answering your friend's questions (typecommon for both items and the subtype for each of the two items)? Regarding learning andstorage of these, which region(s) are often pointed out?
		- What kind of memory system/type needs to be updated and what region will be involved forrunning your modified bike? Given the kicks you get from succeeding to improve your riding,what kind of learning can you assume to be involved? 
	- Describe the mechanisms underlying the post-synaptic expression of LTP. 
	- What kind of memories can and cannot be formed when hippocampus is removed
	- What kind of memories cannot be formed when amygdala is damaged? 
	- How does synaptic plasticity depend on (i) firing rate of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons and (ii) relative timing of spiking in pre- and postsynaptic neurons? In both cases draw a sketch of the changes in the synaptic weight as a function of firing rate and relative timing of spikes.
- **Spatial navigation** [[Neuro Answers - Spatial navigation]] 
- **Cerebellum** [[Neuro Answers - Cerebellum]]
	- Draw the schematic of neuronal circuitry in the cerebellum. Clearly indicate the variousexcitatory and inhibitory connections. You are not supposed to draw neuron shapes. It issufficient to draw a box to indicate a particular type of neuron.
	- What kind of functional deficits arise when there is a lesion in the cerebellum? Explain whatthese lesions tell about the function role of cerebellum?
	- How do climbing fibers affect the activity of Purkinje cells?
	- What aspects of motor control are regulated by the cerebellum?
	- Which are the two, principally different, kinds of information that are being processed in the cerebellum, and how is this information used?
	- A cellular mechanism that is thought to underly the regulatory function of the cerebellar cortex is called long-term depression (LTD). Explain briefly what is meant by LTD, and how this mechanism is thought to underly the regulatory function of the cerebellum
	- Which are the main types of neurons in the cerebellar cortex and how are they connected?
	- What is the main role of cerebellum?
- **Synaptic plasticity** [[Neuro Answers - Synaptic platicity]]
	- Synaptic strength depends on Calcium level on the postsynaptic side. What is therelationship between Calcium level and synaptic weight change -- draw the relationshipschematically. Why is postsynaptic depolarization necessary for changing synaptic weights?
	- Two neurons are bidirectionally coupled and spike in the way shown in Figure 3. Theneurons show synaptic timing dependent plasticity. What will happen to the synaptic weightsw12 and w21 in response to this spike pattern:i.when the spike rate is 1 Hz? (​1.5 P​)ii.when the spike rate is 50 Hz? (​1.5 P​)Give a brief explanation of why the weights will increase or decrease in each case.
	- When adults who were born deaf or became deaf in early infancy, receive cochlear implants,they have a very hard time learning to use the implants and hear sounds. By contrast, whendeaf children get cochlear implants very early in their childhood, they are able to learn tolisten to sounds in an almost normal way. Why might this be the case? ​You can build youranswer based on experiments with kittens in which their eyes were sutured at different timepoints in their development.

	- is it possible for neurons to communicate with other neurons via subthreshold potentials? Ifyes, then how?
	- Plasma membrane of the nerve cells is usually polarized even without external signals beingin its normal environment. What is this phenomenon called and which cellular mechanismscontribute to it?

- **Basal ganglia** [[Neuro Answers - Basal ganglia]]
	- Draw the schematic of the basal ganglia and highlight the direct and indirect pathways.Clearly indicate excitatory and inhibitory connections.
	- Now consider an experiment in which D1 neurons or D2 neurons are selectively activated.The direct and indirect pathway model predicts whether firing rate will be increased ordecreased and animal movement will be facilitated or suppressed when D1 or D2 neuronsare activated. Based on this model fill in the following table with increase or decrease ineach box. We expect you to draw the following table in your answer sheet and fill the answeras increase or decrease -- please do not indicate your answer with arrows. 
	- Each of the two neuron populations forms part of two separate pathways through the basal ganglia. Activity in these two pathways results in different effects on the motor behaviour. Name and describe the two pathways, and give a brief account for the mechanisms behind their respective motor effect.
