It is not only the final product that is interesting, humans wants to connect and by sharing your process more people can connect with you. The struggle itself is intersting and a learning experience so you dont have to be a master to share your process. Stay truthful and share the truth about your journey and yourself. 

## Summary and notes (this is for very good books that i really want to remember)


### Impressions


### How I Discovered It
I came in contact with the book through a youtuber "Ali abdaal" who is a medical doctor and a productivity youtuber.

### Who Should Read It
Anyone can read the book because I think there is something to learn here for everyone. But with that being said i think you would get the most out of the book if you have already been thinking about putting yourself out there like i had prior to reading the book. Because then many of tips and tricks that the book shares becomes actionable advice. 

## How The Book Changed Me
Before reading this book I was already thinking about sharing stuff on a blog. This book gave me the conviction to actually do this and at the same time it removed any hesitation i had about not having enough to share, or even having something worth sharing.

Even though i was already thinking about sharing my work, the way it is described here in this book made me think of it as creative work. Something that I did not consider it to be before reading this book. And this had the effect that I, i admit prematurely, started considering myself as a creative person or someone that is creating something. This is very new to me as i always thought that i had zero creativity as a person but now i realize that it was simply due to me having a very narrow idea of what it means to be a creative content creator. For me this is huge and something that i will remember for a very long time and be grateful to the author of this book.

## My Top 3 Quotes
- The impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful , its is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes. 

- Dont think about your website as a self-promotion machine but rather a self-invention machine

- You can't plan on anything; you can only go about your work every day, without hope or despair. You cant count on success; you can only leave open the possibility for it, and be ready to jump on and take the ride when it comes for you.
