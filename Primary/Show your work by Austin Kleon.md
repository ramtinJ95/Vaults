### Impressions
The book is very well written and there was no fluff at all. This lack of fluff made it a very quick read. Even though it was a quick read i must say that the consequence of this book and the impact it has and will continue to have on my thinking and my life will be disportionatly large. Its quite impressive how the author managed to cram so much knowledge and actionable advice in so little text, a standard that I and anyone who wants to write should aim for. 

### How I Discovered It
I came in contact with the book through a youtuber "Ali abdaal" who is a medical doctor and a productivity youtuber.

### Who Should Read It
Anyone can read the book because I think there is something to learn here for everyone. But with that being said i think you would get the most out of the book if you have already been thinking about putting yourself out there like i had prior to reading the book. Because then many of tips and tricks that the book shares becomes actionable advice. 

## How The Book Changed Me
Before reading this book I was already thinking about sharing stuff on a blog. This book gave me the conviction to actually do this and at the same time it removed any hesitation i had about not having enough to share, or even having something worth sharing.

Even though i was already thinking about sharing my work, the way it is described here in this book made me think of it as creative work. Something that I did not consider it to be before reading this book. And this had the effect that I, i admit prematurely, started considering myself as a creative person or someone that is creating something. This is very new to me as i always thought that i had zero creativity as a person but now i realize that it was simply due to me having a very narrow idea of what it means to be a creative content creator. For me this is huge and something that i will remember for a very long time and be grateful to the author of this book.

## My Top 3 Quotes
- The impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful , its is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes. 

- Dont think about your website as a self-promotion machine but rather a self-invention machine

- You can't plan on anything; you can only go about your work every day, without hope or despair. You cant count on success; you can only leave open the possibility for it, and be ready to jump on and take the ride when it comes for you.
