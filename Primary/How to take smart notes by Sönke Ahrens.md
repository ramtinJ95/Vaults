# How to take smart notes

### The Book In 3 Sentences
Writing and thinking should be synonyms if we want to learn that which we are reading. This process of using writing as thinking can be efficiently attained by note taking using a system. That system is called slip-box and is the idea that we store notes we take while we read and link ideas and concepts even tho they come from different sources. 

## Summary and notes

### Notes and interesting ideas from the book
- Good structure is something that I can trust. It should remove the burden of remembering from me and yet at the same time keep track of everything. Good structure does **not** mean planning. Imposing a plan on yourself makes you inflexible, and makes us use willpower something that we want to avoid. Structure is and should be the goal instead.

- The ZettelKasten basics:
	1. Take small fleeting notes on anything that interests you during the day. Any idea or thoughts are welcome here but it should be recorded in a way that at least  gives some hint to the context

### Impressions
The book is actually quite convincing when it comes to the core arguments. The author does a good job of providing papers and examples of why it is a good idea to read and write in the way that is proposed. I think that some parts of the book become to long winded or even repetitive. Although with that being said it could be because i have had exposure to these ideas earlier and that the author was simply trying to use spaced repletion to really drive home some key ideas.

I think that some of the later chapters deviate a bit from the core ideas of the book and that they really dont provide any value at least for me especially chapter 12 and 13. Again this could be because by this point i was already aboard the core concepts and had gotten the gist as the author like to say.

The only other negative aspect of the book is that the author is so overly sold on the idea of the slip-box that he ascribes many beneficial effects of spaced repetition and insight to this method itself. I think the whole thing went a bit overboard and it almost made it seem like this system was magic or that it was the answer to everything. And personally im wary of such sensationalism always. 

### How I Discovered It
I had seen the book being mentioned before when i was learning about the zettelkasten method. And i decided that I should get serious about using this slip-box method (i.e zettelkasten) and after going through some tutorials on the web and reading some articles and forum posts about this system for thinking and linking ideas together it was time to take the plunge and give it a read.

### Who Should Read It
For everyone that is interested in learning how to read better and take good notes really. I would recommend it for people who enjoy reading nonfiction and those that like writing because you cannot write without reading well. The system that is suggested i think is a bit more niche, for me it is excellent and I will recommend the system to everyone but I have a hard time imagining the average person being ready to invest such effort just to organize their notes on a few books they read every year. 

## How The Book Changed Me
The book really put my strategies of learning into perspective. I truly had no idea how inefficient and bad my strategies where. Also the idea of so actively reading with a pen in my hand and actually almost having an conversation with author while reading the book is so revolutionary for me. I would have thought that it would be a waste of time to read so thoroughly but the waste of time is reading something and then not getting much use out of it.

More practically i think the book has made me a better reader and writer and the result of these improvements is that i also have become better at thinking. 

## My Top 3 Quotes
- Tools are only as good your ability to work with them. everybody knows how to handle a flute (you blow into one end and press your fingers on the holes according to the notes you are playing), but nobody would try it once and then judge the instrument on what they hear.

- If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing

- Notes build up while you think, read , understand and generate ideas, because you have to have a pen in your hand if you want to think.read, understand and generate ideas properly anyway.
