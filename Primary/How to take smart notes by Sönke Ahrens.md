# How to take smart notes

### The Book In 3 Sentences
Writing and thinking should be synonyms if we want to learn that which we are reading. This process of using writing as thinking can be efficiently attained by note taking using a system. That system is called slip-box and is the idea that we store notes we take while we read and link ideas and concepts even tho they come from different sources. 

## Summary and notes

### Notes and interesting ideas from the book
- Good structure is something that I can trust. It should remove the burden of remembering from me and yet at the same time keep track of everything. Good structure does **not** mean planning. Imposing a plan on yourself makes you inflexible, and makes us use willpower something that we want to avoid. Structure is and should be the goal instead.

- The ZettelKasten basics:
	1. Take small fleeting notes on anything that interests you during the day. Any idea or thoughts are welcome here but it should be recorded in a way that at least  gives some hint to the context
	2. Take literature notes. All reading I do should be accompanied by notes. Here we want to write down stuff we dont want to forget and stuff we thinki we will be able to use in our own thinking. Key here is to keep it short and be selective. 
	3. Create permanent notes that goes into the zettelkasten by going through the notes from step 1 and 2. This should be done ideally once everyday and reflect on how they fit into what is relevent to my own interests and relevant focus areas. The point is **NOT TO COLLECT** but rather the goal is to **DEVELOP** ideas,arguments and discussions. Some guiding questions could be:
		1.  How does this new info relate to whats already in the zettelkasten?
		2.  What new ideas, whats wrong, are there contradictions?
	4.  If possible when we are adding the permanent note we should do one more thing beyond linking it to related notes and making sure we can find the note itself through an index or a MOC. We should put them "behind" the related notes so that there is some kind of chain of ideas or arguments i can follow in a chronological order when revisiting some notes. 

- write as you are writing for someone else. Write so others understand and cite sources always. 

- When thinking about how to link the note if it's not obvious ask myself the question "In which context do i want to stumble upon this note again?"

- When reading and coming across something that provokes an interesting thought note it in a fleeting note and add sources and references to the source material on that note. Then before adding it do the reference or bibliographic zettelkasten read that note and think about its relevance for my own lines of thought and write about this. This new note will then become a perma note in the zettelkasten with a reference to the fleeting note in the bibliographic note.

- Zeignarik effect, something to do with memory 

- Ego depletion refers to a temporary reduction in ones capacity or willingness to engage in volitional (means relating to ones will) action.

- For literature and reference notes we dont have to worry about the length since they are there to to help us understand. 

- Important to be hyper-aware of confirmation bias at all times. One approach to do this could be to write down arguments against our beliefs and see if we can "fight" them with what we currently know and understand. 

- Write brief summaries on the main ideas of a text. It is important to be able to also think about what a text is not mentioning and a the same questions the limitations of the frameworks presented and try and think of the information presented could be of use in some other framework. 

- One measure of Productivity that makes sense when dealing with nonfiction/academic writing is measuring the number of perma notes per day. Luhman averaged 6 a day. So if I average 1-3 a day now in the beginning that is already a big step forward.

- Writing permanent notes directly from our thoughts and then reinforcing the arguments and ideas in those notes with other notes and references notes and literature notes is the ideal way of using the zettelkasten. 

- Write with an eye towards existing notes

- External scaffolding a concepts that reoccurs a lot in the later parts if the book.

- A good question to ask myself when creating fleeting notes into perm notes is why did i take those fleeting noteS? What does all this mean for my research and the other notes in my zettelkasten? Also take notes with an eye towards the arguments of the book itself.

- Solomon shereshevsky a dude that remember everything, this is connected with the phenomenon active inhibition which is what we do to suppress all the data that comes into our head so that we can sort it and use it. 

- Learning is **NOT** about storing stuff but rather its about the strength of retrieval from our memory bank. And furthermore about retrieving the correct thing given a cue. which would explain why anki and SRS system are so good.

- The zettelkasten is a tool to think with it is not an encyclopedia.

- The bibliography of this book itself is a gold mine if one is interested in how writing,reading, memory and learning has been researched about. 


### Impressions
The book is actually quite convincing when it comes to the core arguments. The author does a good job of providing papers and examples of why it is a good idea to read and write in the way that is proposed. I think that some parts of the book become to long winded or even repetitive. Although with that being said it could be because i have had exposure to these ideas earlier and that the author was simply trying to use spaced repletion to really drive home some key ideas.

I think that some of the later chapters deviate a bit from the core ideas of the book and that they really dont provide any value at least for me especially chapter 12 and 13. Again this could be because by this point i was already aboard the core concepts and had gotten the gist as the author like to say.

The only other negative aspect of the book is that the author is so overly sold on the idea of the slip-box that he ascribes many beneficial effects of spaced repetition and insight to this method itself. I think the whole thing went a bit overboard and it almost made it seem like this system was magic or that it was the answer to everything. And personally im wary of such sensationalism always. 

### How I Discovered It
I had seen the book being mentioned before when i was learning about the zettelkasten method. And i decided that I should get serious about using this slip-box method (i.e zettelkasten) and after going through some tutorials on the web and reading some articles and forum posts about this system for thinking and linking ideas together it was time to take the plunge and give it a read.

### Who Should Read It
For everyone that is interested in learning how to read better and take good notes really. I would recommend it for people who enjoy reading nonfiction and those that like writing because you cannot write without reading well. The system that is suggested i think is a bit more niche, for me it is excellent and I will recommend the system to everyone but I have a hard time imagining the average person being ready to invest such effort just to organize their notes on a few books they read every year. 

## How The Book Changed Me
The book really put my strategies of learning into perspective. I truly had no idea how inefficient and bad my strategies where. Also the idea of so actively reading with a pen in my hand and actually almost having an conversation with author while reading the book is so revolutionary for me. I would have thought that it would be a waste of time to read so thoroughly but the waste of time is reading something and then not getting much use out of it.

More practically i think the book has made me a better reader and writer and the result of these improvements is that i also have become better at thinking. 

## My Top 3 Quotes
- Tools are only as good your ability to work with them. everybody knows how to handle a flute (you blow into one end and press your fingers on the holes according to the notes you are playing), but nobody would try it once and then judge the instrument on what they hear.

- If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing

- Notes build up while you think, read , understand and generate ideas, because you have to have a pen in your hand if you want to think.read, understand and generate ideas properly anyway.
