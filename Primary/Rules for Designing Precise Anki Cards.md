# Rules for Designing Precise Anki Cards

Number one rule when adding cards is this: Each time i come across something that i want to remember i **have** to **identify excatly what i want to know** and i have to be as precise as i can be. After I have done this then and only then should i create one ore more cards that ask exactly that. 

**Questions should permit exactly one answer.** It is very very very important that it is immediately obvious what is being asked and what **single** response counts as the correct answer. In other words my thought process and answer must be the same every time i review otherwise the effect is lost. If i end up in a situation during a review where i give and answer that i think is correct but it is not the answer i had entered on the card i should stop the reviewing and rewrite the card. ^38e7fe

Dont fall in to the "example" trap. Questions like "whats an example of X" are very bad because they break the principle above. This does not mean that questions with the word "example" in them are bad but rather that they have to be phrased correctly. For example " X is an example of ...." or "this and that is an example of X"


Do not allow multiple interperations of a question. Always add context in the question itself. So the goal is that the question will be understandable as a standalone question even years from now, so it is important that the question itself allows us to understand what it's about and the level of detail in the answer. To solve the context issue it is smart to add some kind of prefix like: (CS) what is LaTeX, instead of: what is latex which would be hard to answer because it could be any of many things


Questions should not be build around a particular source ever. 

Adding different variants off the same question: [[Using Spaced Revision Systems#^cff067]]

Do not allow for yes and no questions, if such cards are found then they need to be refactored.
