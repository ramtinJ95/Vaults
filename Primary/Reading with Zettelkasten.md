# Reading with Zettelkasten

I already have a new idea and method to try for learning fast and efficiently [[Drilling down Speed up learning]]. This note is more about how the zettelkasten system that I'm using for my notes synergies well with the concepts and methods explained in [[Drilling down Speed up learning]].

It is obvious how zettelkasten system helps with the Practice and Insight stages. **Practice** i will write about what i read. **Insight** I will obtain insights when i add notes to my zettel and connect them to other notes.

The coverage part which will mostly have to do with reading is not part of this. But how do we read efficiently? By taking good and efficient notes since writing is thinking and to learn and understand we have to do deliberate thinking. Alas the zettel system helps with this too!

## Getting information Out of a Text
Two stages for getting information out of a text:
1. Collecting
2. Processing

### Collecting
At this stage we want to read fast and generate notes of anything and everything that we think is interesting or that we think that we will want to remember later. Majorly important we actually only take notes here with references to where in the book etc no highlights or other low effort methods allowed. And all the stuff has to be written with my own words.

### Processing 
Look at all the notes and see if there are any clusters of the notes around some central ideas etc. See how the different notes relate to each other or if they are all referencing some specific idea in the text then it may be worth to go back to it and investigate further. But also think about the fact that not all notes are created equal and it could be that many of the notes will be of no use. 

After we have looked at all these quick and "dirty" notes comes to time to rewrite these notes into one or maybe two notes of the #üå±  or preferably #üå≥  type and see how they link to other notes in our zettel, this is the step that will take longer the larger the zettel gets but dont worry this is a good sign. 

## General Reading tips
There are four main questions I should ask myself when i read a book:
1. What is the book about as a whole?
2. What is being said in detail and how?
3. Is the book true in whole or part?
4. What of it? If the book has give you info ask about its significance. Why does the author think it is important to know these things? Is it important to you to know them? And if the book has not only informed you, but also enlightened you, it is necessary to seek further enlightenment by asking

Again just to really drive the point home here, it is very very very important to read properly when reading. And reading properly means that we read with pen in and and paper at our side and really question the things that we read. Reading done well for the purpose of understanding and learning should be almost like a conversion between the author and you as the reader.
