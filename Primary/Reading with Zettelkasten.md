# Reading with Zettelkasten

I already have a new idea and method to try for learning fast and efficiently [[Drilling down Speed up learning]]. This note is more about how the zettelkasten system that I'm using for my notes synergies well with the concepts and methods explained in [[Drilling down Speed up learning]].

It is obvious how zettelkasten system helps with the Practice and Insight stages. **Practice** i will write about what i read. **Insight** I will obtain insights when i add notes to my zettel and connect them to other notes.

The coverage part which will mostly have to do with reading is not part of this. But how do we read efficiently? By taking good and efficient notes since writing is thinking and to learn and understand we have to do deliberate thinking. Alas the zettel system helps with this too!
