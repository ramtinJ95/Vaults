## Important points
Different types of neuroplasticity. Short is getting up for a flight, medium time is studying just for getting an A. Long term is when the change is permanent and almost becomes reflexive which is the ultimate goal.

Cronotypes worth looking into. 

accumulation of adenasine makes us sleepy, caffein suppresses this.

Go, NO GO circuit in the basal ganglia this circuit is quite metabolically heavy.

carbs and triptofane there is a connection there. 

working out later can lead to a phase delay which is because of increase in temperature in the body and alertness levels, this has to be looked into by me 

## Discussion points
Waking up more groggy and tired then we would want to does not need to me that we are lacking rest but that the timing is off.

Delay consumption of caffein early, give it 2h upon waking up. Getting light into the eyes upon waking up helps with alertness. If there is no natural light a lamp that is around 900 lux helps too.

So he finally explains why sometimes background music helps and sometimes not. If we have high arousal of our autonomous nervousystem then background music will be destructive. If we have low arousal i.e feel a bit low on energy then it helps. 

Working out earlier in the day is usually better. But has to be quite immediate, say within 1 - 2 hour of waking up. We want to do it fast so we dont interfere with the peak alertness period that occurs naturally. 

drinking a little bit of sodium water in the morning can be beneficial if we drink a lot of water and coffee since these could cause us to be dehydrated. 

Lunch should be low carb unless we have had a heavy workout session.

Once we start getting tired or groggy mid day then we should change the nature of the work to not require heavy focus. 

A protocol for deep rest at around 16 for 10-30 like a yoganidra or a hypnosis, we want to reach non sleep deep rest that is the goal. After this then we can do some work that requires heavy focus. 

Getting light in the evening is also very beneficial. Morning light makes u likely to get up earlier the next day evening light makes u get up later so these 2 counter act each other. 

Evening meal carb rich and easy to digest protein. 

Small blip of anxiety during the evening is normal and a hardwired burst of energy comes 45-60min before sleep.
