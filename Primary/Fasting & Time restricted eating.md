# Fasting
## Important points
When you eat is as important as what you eat, especially when it comes to liver health and mental health

The body and the brain cannot distinguish between psychological and physical stress. It is all nervous system. This means that thinking hard produces the same stress and training hard. 

### General stuff
When you eat blood glucose will go up and with this insulin goes up too.

Amount of time matters when it comes to these things. Just because we stop eating does not mean that our glucose and insulin levels goes down immediately. 

when we eat can enhance or diminish our health. So eating during the nocturnal phase of the day leads to diminishing health effects. because it fucks with the circadian rhythm genes

Liver suffers when you eat around the clock. Time restricted eating reverses the damage or improves even further. The reason the liver gets sick if you have to big of an eating window is that the inflammotary markers in the body that are increased. They are increased because the process of digestion and gastric emptying is resource intensive. Note that these markers are not inherently bad they are there for a reason. 

Fasting that occurs during sleep is special because it is assoctiaed with a number of process that related to the glymphatic system, which is a system that sweeps out lymfpathic fluids from the brain and is the way that the brain clear itself from metabolic debree. 

Fasting start usually 3-5 hours after your last bite of food since before that you may stop putting food into your mouth but that does not mean that your body is in a fasting state yet. It is important for the body that certain conditions are met before the body can enter any kind of new state. 

6-8h is the golden standard eating window. 

protein synthesis is somewhat higher early in the day and this in turn makes it easier to attain muscle hyperthropy as well. If the goal is to maintain or increase muscle size, it is beneficial to consume protein early in the day. Note that the training time itself does not actually matter here.

It is very important that eating happens during the same 8h window each day. So this means that if one eats from 12:00 to 20:00 during the week, it is crucial that the same pattern is there during the weekends as well. Otherwise this will affect the rhythms of genes and other processes that depend on this regularity. It takes 2-3 days to recover from this.

Glucose clearing. Walking after eating is huge, especially after your last meal. this will lower blood glucose and make you go to sleep in a more fasted state. 

Glucose disposal agents. Burbureen over the counter drug. Only combine with high carb meals. Can cause extreme headaches because you become hyperglycemic.

mTor is a protein that is very active in cells when they are growing(healthy and unhealthy), these are active when we are not fasting. But processes that become active while we are not growing i.e when we are in a fasted state are more geared towards cell repair and restoration, these proteins are ampk and certuins.

Fasting helps IBS and gut bacteria. fasting affects clock genes and these genes affect the mucys lining of the stomach. fasting reduces the amount of lactobysilis. 

Brown fat is very good. we want to promote the production of this. 

Reductions in kortisol if following a good pattern of eating window. This may lead to decrease in depression. 

time restricted eating biases the body to use fat as an energy source when eating sub-maintenence kcal. They way body does this is through increasing hypatic lipase. This is the enzyme that metabolises fat for lypolisis. reduces cidec lipid droplet associated and lypolisis inhibitor. 

Blood glucose levels are the ultimate indicator of weather or not we are in a fasted state. black coffee does not break fast. Time matters for this. 1g of suger after dinner will increase your blood glucose. This also means that if you have a heavy and intense workout and after this eat a small meal that is very high in fat chances are that you will not increase your blood glucose level enough to where you are out of the fasted state, mct oil is something that is used here.  


 cinnamon, lemon and lime juice can improve or lead to glucose disposal/clearing. Mixing salt into lemon water makes further improves the glucose clearing effects but salt counteracts the feeling of dizziness and or shakiness that can arise from having lemon juice in the morning due to having too little glucose in the blood all of a sudden.
 
 Also using salt during a fast can enchance both the mental clarity and performence as well as decreasing hunger levels and thus allowing one to fast for a longer time.
