# Business Ideas

- An application where one enters in what you eat during the day and what you have done for example if you have done some kind of exercise etc. This will then be used to see how it affects your mental health subjectively i.e you will tell us how you feel day to day and we will start seeing if there is some correlation there as well as objectively where some score will be calculated on how you should feel based on your choices that week based on research. This will then include some kind of ML to give predictions etc. And it will be primarily a mental health app so the goal will be to get in some mental health too . 

- A family/friend management system where everyone calendars are synced and all the activities of everyone is collected in one place and then there will be some kind of algorithm that suggests times where the family/friends can meetup in a way that fits the activity and everyone schedules. And this will also have budgeting features where one can see on exactly what the family is spending money and at each activity how much money is spent on what etc. It can also be then be used to give suggestions on peoples time management etc, maybe even weave in the personal digital assistant idea i have had for such a long time i.e Jarvis style personal assistant. Another cool feature would be to incorporate productivity tools directly into the calendars, for example imagine one could block out an hour somewhere in ones calendar then 10 min before that one hour there would be some kind of notification sent to people that this person does not want to be disturbed at all during this one hour etc.
