Doing something small everyday is the absolute best way of accomplishing big goals. And something that I will start implementing in my life starting next Monday.

One very good idea that i was from this link https://github.com/mentimeter/render-api/pull/1012
is to have weeknotes. This is essentially a write up that does not have to be too long about what I have done that week. No deadlines no goal no pressure. Only systems and habits.
