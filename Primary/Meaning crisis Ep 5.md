Platos main contribution or lets say main idea is that there are three competing modes in your minds or within our bodies that are there. The first one is the rational man in our head which is capable of planning long term and show restraint and understands the value of sacrifice in the current time to gain value in the longer term. The second is the lion within. This symbolizes our feelings of shame and honor. Also this reflects our need to belong to the group and shows our cultural needs and desires. The last one is the monster. This is not capable of long term planning, and it is only interested in the maximum amount of pleasure right here right now. 

What we need to do in order to become better humans and become enlightened is to educate the man, so that he can learn to train the lion so that they together can tame, yes tame not kill, the monster. It is when this is our inner world when we have inner peace and can truly think and see reality for what it is.

Plato had this idea of this cave where people are chained looking at the cave walls where there are shadows from a flame, they think that those shadows are what is reality. Then one of them gets free and sees that which they see on the cave walls are mere shadows of the real objects. He then start looking around and finds a tunnel that leads out of the cave. But for every level that he gets up he comes in contact with more of the natural light and has to take a break. After some time he gets all the way up and sees the sun and is in awe of what is then representing layer zero of reality, i.e true reality. But when he tries to go back down to tell the others they cannot understand him for they have not gone through the transformation he as gone through and he cannot longer see well in the darkness since his eyes are no longer adapted to that darkness. 

What is intersting from this story is that every step of the transcendence in the tunnel takes some time to get used to when being exposed to a level of light which one was not used to before. and this light then represents truth about reality.
