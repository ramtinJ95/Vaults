#### Short term plasticity
Phase sequences slid in min 16. at min 27 he explains short term facilitation and depression of neurons. this has to with weight changes of synapse connections. 

One good slide with implications of these short term dynamics of synapses is at min 32.  

#### Long term plasticity
LTP: Long term potentiation
At min 6:30 he talks about the process of how LTP happens. It seems to have to do with calcium coming into the cell and starting some kind of protein kinase that in turn leads to more receptrs being made and pushed out into the cell membrane and this is essentially how the synaptic weight changes. This is all in the post synaptic neuron.


LTD : Long term dpression. Experiment shows that low frequence stimulation leads to long term decrease in synaptic strength. this process is the same as above. The idea is that the concetration of the calcuim at diffrent thresholds leads to different effects in the neuron. 

min 22 part 2 has good info on hebbian learning.

min 30 part 2 shows experiemnt that show that the threshold for LTP can change. 

STPD: Spike timing dependet plasticity first experiemnt at min 33

STDP: Location dependence min 39.

Inhibitory STDP is at min 43. 

summary at min 44 that show what else can change synaptic weight. 

minute 47 very good explanation of how network things are in action in the brain. 


#### Structural plasticity at min 50
This is how we get new synapces that where not there or remove synapses that where there. Previous to this its all about existing ones that are either strengthened or weakened. 


#### Critical period
min 53 this is explained in a experiment.
