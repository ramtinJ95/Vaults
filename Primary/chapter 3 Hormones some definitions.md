 Endometriosis: only the epithelium of the uterus should react to estrogens by growing in order to allow nidation of the trophoblast. When cells outside the uterus, such as in the peritoneum and in other organs of a woman, start to react to the periodic estrogen signals by growing and ablation, the woman feels great pain and experiences internal bleeding.
 
 Exocrine release, as opposed to endocrine secretion into the blood, characterizes gland productionâ€”for example, release into the oral cavity, into the gut lumen, or across the skin. Furthermore, odorant release, territory marking, and pheromone secretion are exocrine processes as well.
 ### Neurontransmitters
 Hormones which act via the blood circulation must be distinguished from neurotransmitters such as GABA, acetylcholine, and opioids, whose effects are concentrated on the synaptic cleft between nerve cell and target cell. There are, however, some substances that act as hormones distantly from where they have been released and function as neurotransmitters as well: dopamine and noradrenaline (norepinephrine). Other hormones such as vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) and neuropeptide Y are also active as neurotransmitters.
 
 ### Colestrol and Steroids
 A characteristic feature of steroid-forming cells is the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, which transfers cholesterol from the plasma membrane into mitochondria, where the first step of vertebrate steroid synthesis occurs: conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone. Starting from pregnenolone, all the other human steroids are synthesized in a series of conversions. These steps require several enzymes. The presence or absence of these enzymes is the critical determinant which decides whether in a given cell cortisol or estradiol is made.
 
 Sometimes the final steroid product is stored in the cell. More often these steroids are released immediately after synthesis by diffusion into the cellular environment. Thus, the release of a steroid hormone is regulated not by a signal for release of preformed molecules, but by activating the gene for the rate-limiting or final enzyme in the synthesis cascade.
