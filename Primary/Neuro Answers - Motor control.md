In the course book the part about premotor cortex which is the relevant part for the questions asked starts at page 12. With a good summary on their differences and uses at page 17.

lateral premotor cortex seems so be related to the model stuff. There is some kind of spiking of neuron even before the action itself is performed. So something happend during the planning phase of the movement. 

Medial premotor cortex is also involved in these internal model stuffs. 

regarding internal models and the question regarding the racket there is a very good link that i found: https://link-springer-com.focus.lib.kth.se/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_2528
