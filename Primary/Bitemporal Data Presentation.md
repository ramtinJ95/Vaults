### What is it good for?
There are some significant business benefits of bitemporal data models. They enable you to easily and quickly navigate through time as follows.

-   Analytics: Perform queries that relate to what was known to the system at a particular point in time (not necessarily now)
-   Continuous analytics: Avoid the need to pause or stop data processing or take snapshots of databases to perform point-in-time aggregations and calculations
-   Integrity and consistency: Deliver consistent reports, aggregations, and queries for a period at a point in time
-   Deeper insights and decisions: Support machine learning and predictive models by incorporating accurate state of the system, relationships and time-based events and measurements
-   Auditability and traceability: Record and reconstruct the history of changes of an entity across time, providing forensic auditability of updates to data
