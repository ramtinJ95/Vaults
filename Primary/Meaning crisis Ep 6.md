Aristotle was Plato's disciple, his main contribution or development of Plato's ideas is change. Plato did not really touch on the subject of change.

Growth and development are central to meaning in our lives.

Emmanuel Kant was thinking about why the newtonian world view took over the Aristotle one so fast, and concluded that it was because in the newtonian world view we had chains of causes and you could always explain event C by saying that event B had to happen before it and A before that etc. So you got out of infinite regress and infinite cycles of explanations. But Kant looked at a tree and saw that the tree was the leafs, and the leafs in turn where the tree and so on, so there was feedback loops, i.e cycle explanations in nature so he concluded that a theory of biology would be impossible. But the solution to his dilemma is dynamical systems theory.

### Dynamical systems theory
there are mainly two things. 
* Causes --> Events --> causes things to happen --> actuality
* Constraints --> conditions --> makes things possible --> potentiality
	* potentiality has two branches which are; enabling constraints and selective constraints

Actuality is how something is in reality. Potentiality is the possibility of something to be there. For example wood can become a chair or a table. We would say that the wood i actually a chair, but the wood had the potential of becoming a chair or a table. And for the platonic and Aristotle world view this  constraints part is much more important than the causes. While in the newtonian world view, causes are the most important.

Evolution is the first dynamical systems theory in science. The feedback loop here is reproduction. Darwin noticed that there are selective constraints in the environment that reduce the options for organism. And the major constraint is that of scarcity of resources. In fact there was no evolution in the beginning of life because there was not scarcity of resources. so life was static. But there are enabling constraints as well that open up the options, this is what we call variation. 

Selective constraints are called as virtual governor in dynamical systems theory, enabling constraints are called as virtual generator. The idea is that if you put a virtual governor systematically together with a virtual generator such that you are systematically regulating a feedback cycle, the whole thing is a virtual engine. 

Socrates saw wisdom as overcoming self deception. Plato adds the whole structural theory of the psyche to explain how we overcome self deception and become wise. Aristotle thinks that whats missing is an account of how to develop wisdom and meaning. 

So Aristotle introduces the idea of character. Character is not personality. Character is something you can cultivate. When we critique someones Character it is a moral judgement. Characters have virtues, and a virtue is essentially a virtual engine, since we are talking about a set of conditions that have been cultivated in somebody systematically. What system of constraints have you identified with and what system of constraints have you internalised that regulate your development. 

Part of what gives life meaning is that you have cultivated your character such that you are growing and living up to your potential. Thus take the conscious time to cultivate your character, since nothing is more impactful or more important in life. 

Aristotle says: Ignorance is doing the wrong thing because you dont know. Foolishness is doing the wrong thing when you know what the right thing is. We act foolishly because although we have the correct beliefs, notice here the impotence of belief, we dont have sufficient character to do the right things.  So that is what you should do, i.e cultivate your character so act less foolishly. 

If we say that a knife is well made, how are we making that measurement? We are thinking that the knife is made really well to fit its purpose, which is to cut. And thus the work that went into making the structural functional organization of metal into this knife was meaningful. aha so purpose is what gives meaning in a sense, what then is your purpose? Your purpose is simply to be as fully human as possible.

What separates humans from everything else on this planet? The capability to cultivate character to become as rational as possible. The ability to stop self deception. To cultivate the character to be rational and moral is your purpose. You are a good person if you actualize, if you inform your being with a virtual engine that realises those things that are distinctive of our humanity. What makes us different?  The capability to cultivate character to become as rational as possible. The ability to stop self deception. To cultivate the character to be rational. So your purpose is, again, to become as fully human as possible.
