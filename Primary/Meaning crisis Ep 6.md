Aristotle was Plato's disciple, his main contribution or development of Plato's ideas is change. Plato did not really touch on the subject of change.

Growth and development are central to meaning in our lives.

Emmanuel Kant was thinking about why the newtonian world view took over the Aristotle one so fast, and concluded that it was because in the newtonian world view we had chains of causes and you could always explain event C by saying that event B had to happen before it and A before that etc. So you got out of infinite regress and infinite cycles of explanations. But Kant looked at a tree and saw that the tree was the leafs, and the leafs in turn where the tree and so on, so there was feedback loops, i.e cycle explanations in nature so he concluded that a theory of biology would be impossible. But the solution to his dilemma is dynamical systems theory.

### Dynamical systems theory
there are mainly two things. 
* Causes --> Events --> causes things to happen --> actuality
* Constraints --> conditions --> makes things possible --> potentiality
	* potentiality has two branches which are; enabling constraints and selective constraints

Actuality is how something is in reality. Potentiality is the possibility of something to be there. For example wood can become a chair or a table. We would say that the wood i actually a chair, but the wood had the potential of becoming a chair or a table. And for the platonic and Aristotle world view this  constraints part is much more important than the causes. While in the newtonian world view, causes are the most important.

Evolution is the first dynamical systems theory in science. The feedback loop here is reproduction. Darwin noticed that there are selective constraints in the environment that reduce the options for organism. And the major constraint is that of scarcity of resources. In fact there was no evolution in the beginning of life because there was not scarcity of resources. so life was static. But there are enabling constraints as well that open up the options, this is what we call variation. 

Selective constraints are called as virtual governor in dynamical systems theory, enabling constraints are called as virtual generator. The idea is that if you put a virtual governor systematically together with a virtual generator such that you are systematically regulating a feedback cycle, the whole thing is a virtual engine. 

Socrates saw wisdom as overcoming self deception. Plato adds the whole structural theory of the psyche to explain how we overcome self deception and become wise. Aristotle thinks that whats missing is an account of how to develop wisdom and meaning.
