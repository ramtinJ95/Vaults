# Slowing & Reversing Aging
## Important points
Aging can be considered a disease.

Epigenome is super critical to know about. 

8 or 9 causes of ageing. 1 is major according to David Sinclair and that is the epigenome which is information in the cell.

Body controlls the genome and can regulate which can open and close. 

Horvath clock is the biological clock that we all have.

a group of genes that work against aging called sirtuins 7 of them.

## Discussion points
Ageing can be seen loss of information through time. 2 types of info in body. genetic which is digital. the other one is the system that control which genes are turned on and off which is epigenetic information, can be called the control system.

methyils in the body mark the genome so that the cell know what type of cell it is and stays that way for the rest of your life. so that a nerve cell does not become a skin cell etc. 

how old you look is how old you are.

Horvath clock determines how old your organs and body tissues etc is. Once we reach puberty there is a massive increase in biological age.

Growth hormone is very pro aging. Families in south america which suffer from dwarfism live to mid 90 and seem to be protected from common disease relating to high age such as cancer and heart disease etc. 

Red wine molecule resveratrol. David takes 1000mg a day. has to be gray or white. Has to be taken with little bit of oil. 
Metformin interesting drug that can extend life. Do no take this on days that one is going to work out. This drug works on the mTOR pathway and ampk pathway. 
Take Berberine on days where one is going to overeat such as thanksgiving etc

korsitin trace amounts in apple and oninons, it activates sertuins. It helps in killing sinesin cells (zombie cells that are just there and do damage)

Metabolic winter hypothesis. 

Fat is full of these sinesin cells that release toxins. 

Reducing inflamation in hypathalamus it will increase life. GnRH important hormone in this context. 

Methylation is the process of gene marking. so its the methyls that need be placed in the correct place in the gene. A lot of methylation messes up the epigenome. 

#### How are glucose and sirtuins connected
Sirtuins respond to sugar and insulin. The other system called mTOR senses protein and aminoacid levels in the body. These two communicate. 

Leucine is a key aminoacid in these pathways and starts up mTOR which could be pro aging. Its wise to pulse things. Timing is super important. It is very benefical to pulse fasting and aminoacid intake. 

### fasting
David says is bad to never experience hunger.
Low levels of insulin and insulin like growth factor triggers the longivity genes.
We dont want glucose in the blood too much. 

Even when those that fast and those that dont eat the same, the effects on the fasting ones where significant in regards to health and longevity.

It is very good go 3 days without eating from time to time, called sheperon deep autophagy. 

insulin sensitive is good. 

### Dosing and timing of NAD,NMN, NR ,Resveratrol
sertuins need NAD to work. NAD is super important in the body. CD38 is an enzyme that eats up NAD as you get older. NMN is a precursor to NAD and can be supplemented. So it is useful to think about this as following: Reseveratol revs up the sertuin defenses and makes it so that the body uses the 7 genes more frequently resulting in higher efficenicy of these systems. But the fuel for these process is NAD which the body produces less and less of as we age and if we are sick. So just taking Reseveratol is like revving an engine without fuel, thus it is important to take NMN too.

Other ways to increase NAD is to use NR which is used to make NMN. NR is often made from vitamin B3. It does not work to take a lot of B3 to force to body to make more NAD. 

takes 1000mg NMN everyday. If you wanna buy it look at GMP as a factor at the company. make sure it is white and tastes like burn popcorn.

NAD controls the circadian rythm.  




#### Side notes
Maybe get a glucose monitor for a while to get some datapoints
